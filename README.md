# Loothausen

This is a 2D point and click adventure game. The main purpose of this project is simply to play around with some ideas and homemade graphics. Don't expect anything too fancy or polished here.
Assets such as the dialogues are in German only. I don't plan to add internationalization for this project at all.

## Status

Work in progress.

## Features
- Simple dialogue system based on [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) 
- Basic inventory system
- Point and Click navigation based on [A*](https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
